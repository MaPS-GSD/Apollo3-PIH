### Description
The Apollo Patient Isolation Hood (PIH) is a localized negative-pressure ventilation system for hospital beds to help contain the droplet spread of COVID-19, including during aerosol-generating medical procedures such as intubation/extubation. The PIH encloses a patient’s upper torso and head in a negative-pressure environment. It provides barrier protection between healthcare provider and patient, while the negative pressure environment reduces the likelihood that the aerosolized particles will spread. The hood may also contain the spread of the virus from less critically-ill patients, reducing the need for invasive procedures such as intubation.

>Sentencify --> Barrier protection, aerosol control (via negative pressure), optimal viewing clarity, flexible sealed armports, lightweight (<5 lbs), can be rapidly secured to any bed, fully disposable, scalable,
The versatility of the Apollo PIH means that it can be used in any care setting (OR, PACU, ICU, ED, EMS) and can be rapidly secured to a variety of beds.  The design allows for ease of assembly, use, and disposal. The primary structure is composed of a single flat sheet of PETG plastic that is assembled into a 3-dimensional form, minimizing the number of seams for optimal viewing clarity.  Flexible sealed armports provide...

### Design Concept
The primary design goal of the hood was to enclose the patient’s torso and head without restricting HCP ability to provide care or inducing claustrophobia in patients. The enclosure of the Apollo PIH derives its form and rigidity through the principle of active bending, a structural behavior achieved by the elastic deformation of initially flat elements. The main intention was to leverage this structural principle to create a stable, rapidly deployable 3D form that can be fabricated from readily available sheet materials using minimal joinery.

### Key Features
The primary design element of the Apollo PIH is the enclosure - a thin sheet of clear PET-G plastic in 60mil (approximately 1/16”) thickness.  The enclosure can be CNC cut from a flat sheet of PET-G  measuring a minimum of 48” x 72”.  The Apollo PIH enclosure measures approximately 22” in width, 23” in height and 22” in depth and is approximately 0.15 m3 in volume.

Several key features of the prototype are outlined below:
- (2) arm ports at the rear of the PIH provide healthcare provider (HCP) access to the patient. - An additional auxiliary port on one side of the PIH allows for additional patient access as needed.
- Minimal surface seams allow for an unobstructed view of patient.
- Adaptable attachment mechanism allows for use on a variety of bed types (OR, ICU, etc.)
- Side arms provide a double thickness at the base of the PIH for stability and structure
- Various suction ports accept common negative pressure hoses, including a ⅞” diameter (common in OR) as well as smaller 3/16” ID tubing (common in the ICU).

### Recommended Production Guidelines

#### A) Enclosure
#### 1. Cutting
The Apollo PIH requires a minimum stock size of 72” x 48”. The stock can be cut using a number of CNC processes including a knife cutter, laser cutter, or router.  In the case of a CNC router, a ⅛” diameter endmill is required to successfully cut small interior features.  A list of suggested cut settings are provided below.  Please keep in mind that these settings are specific to the machines listed and will likely need to be modified for other scenarios. 
- Knife Cutter ([Zund G3M2500](https://www.zund.com/en/cutting-systems/digital-cutting-systems/g3-cutter))
  - Bed Size: 98” x 52”
  - Tool: Universal Cutting Tool (UCT) with [glide shoe](https://shop.zund.us/en-us/products/alle-produkte/cutting-accessories/gliding-shoe))
  - Blade: Type6 blade
  - Depth: 0.02” per pass
  - Speed : 6” per second 
  - Total Time : ~ 18 minutes.
- Laser Cutter (*450 Watt Multicam Magnus 48x96 CNC Laser, 4” Focal Lens*)
  - Speed: 480 IPM
  - Power 60%
  - Frequency: 10,000 PPI

#### 2. Base-Plate Braking/Bending
 > Image 🤖
![Apollo3 Patient Isolation Hood](assets/3_Baseplate.jpg)
*Caution : Do not score the material before bending/braking* 

The baseplate portion of the Apollo PIH enclosure must be cold-formed to a 90 degree angle relative to the rest of the enclosure prior to assembly.  To date, this has been successfully accomplished on a sheet metal finger brake such as the Baileigh SBR-4020 shear brake roll ([Link](https://www.baileigh.com/shear-brake-roll-sbr-4020)).
Additional forming processes such as the use of a line brake or heat gun, or design modifications to the enclosure such as eliminating the base plate or incorporating a secondary hinge mechanism, exist as potential alternatives though they have not been tested by the design team. 

#### 3. Push-in Rivets
![Apollo3 Patient Isolation Hood](assets/4_Rivets.jpg)

Push-in plastic rivets were selected as the preferred fastener, as they were simple to use and had no sharp edges that could catch on to clothing, medical instruments etc. 3/16” holes in the main enclosure facilitate the riveting and was done by hand. 16 rivets are needed (8 per side of symmetry) for maintaining the shape of the Apollo while 2 rivets (or 1 rivet & a button snap)are needed for the baseplate ( 1 to pivot (*red*) and 1 to lock (*blue*)).
![Apollo3 Patient Isolation Hood](assets/4a_Baseplatelock.gif)
*The width of the Apollo can be adjusted by adjusting the location of the pivot and the lock.Multiple perforations can be added to have it adapt to a range of widths.*

#### B) ArmPorts + Auxiliary Ports
> Image Here 🤖

Each arm and auxiliary port on the Apollo PIH is composed of three primary components - a laser-cut 5 mil TPU portal, a clear, double-sided adhesive film, and a port cover.  

- TPU Portal: Laser cut from 5 mil TPU.  The portal is an inverted “mercedes” design, with circular relief holes at the tip of each cut to minimize the potential for tearing.  It can be CNC cut on a laser cutter or a knife cutting machine such as a ZUND.
- Adhesive Ring: The adhesive ring can be cut from a sheet of adhesive film.  
- The port cover/flap 

#### C) Bed attachment mechanism
> Image Here 🤖

Perforations are located on the base perimeter (dark blue in Reference drawing) of the back plate to enable the use of cords/straps in order to attach the Apollo to different sized beds.

#### D) Drape
> Image Here 🤖

The drape is a rectangular piece of LDPE with dimensions 85” x 40” . Refer to the reference drawing and assembly instructions for details. A 12” offset has been left on both ends to facilitate tucking under the patient to get a good seal. 

#### E) Tail Piece
> Image Here 🤖
> 
A small sheet of LDPE (Same as Drape) is stuck on the back plate and tucked under the baseplate to cover the gap between the baseplate and the back wall to maintain the seal.

### Assembly
> Image Here 🤖
> 
- Step 01: Place Apollo PIH enclosure on a flat surface with the folded baseplate facing upwards.  
- Step 02: Fasten the opposing sides of the baseplate together using two push-in rivets located on the baseplate.  See detail A for connection detail.  
- Step 03: Fold one side arm toward the interior of the enclosure.  Fasten to the main portion of the enclosure using (8) push-in rivets. 
- Step 04: Repeat Step 03 for the opposite side arm.
- Step 05: Place the Apollo PIH upright so that the baseplate is resting on a horizontal surface. 
- Step 06: Attach the plastic drape to the front edge of the Apollo PIH using double-sided tape.
- Step 07: Fasten the provided straps to one side of the Apollo PIH.
- Step 08: Adhere clear tape over the external seams of the Apollo PIH (one per side), taking care to completely cover the seam. 

### Alternate Details
Below are some alternative details we have experimented with towards the end goal as design variants but these are yet to be tested clinically.

- **Material**

    While the Apollo PIH is designed to be fabricated from PET-G measuring 60mil (~1/16”) in thickness, though early prototypes fabricated from thinner, 30mil (~1/32”) were also sufficiently rigid. 

- **Form**

    Following alternatives have not been checked thoroughly in a clinical setting  and have only been provided as suggestions.

  - Apollo 1 Main Feature:
    - Use of Tabs and Slots instead of hardware
    ![Apollo3 Patient Isolation Hood](assets/10_Apollo1.jpg)

  - Apollo 1.5_Minimal Main Feature:
    - Reduction of overlap and material.
    ![Apollo3 Patient Isolation Hood](assets/11_Apollo1a.jpg)

- **Arm Ports**
  >Image Here 🤖
  ![Apollo3 Patient Isolation Hood](assets/12_Armport.jpg)

Multiple iterations of the armport design were undertaken with various materials and can be found in the diagram above. 
- Versions a and f Require a thinner gauge or extensible material as they can otherwise restrict arm movements while in use. Version f also requires a secondary drape taped over the opening to maintain a seal
- Versions b, c, and e work well with the specified 5+mil TPU and 1/16” silicone sheets (available on McMaster Carr). They feature a self-closing design and when used with the silicone sheets may not require a covering drape. Version c is best for thinner materials that lack the stiffness to hold their shape overwise
- Version d makes use of disposable PPE sleeves widely available in many material types. The sleeve is stretched around a rubber porthole seal (such as [this product).
- Version g simply uses two pieces of the drape material with an overlap to help limit air escape when in use.
- Clear PVC sheets were experimented with in both 0.08” and 0.04” thicknesses but were found to be too stiff to work properly and often grabbed at the sleeves and gloves when in use.
