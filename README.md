### Description
The Apollo Patient Isolation Hood (PIH) is a localized negative-pressure ventilation system for hospital beds to help contain the droplet spread of COVID-19, including during aerosol-generating medical procedures such as intubation/extubation. The PIH encloses a patient’s upper torso and head in a negative-pressure environment. It provides barrier protection between healthcare provider and patient, while the negative pressure environment reduces the likelihood that the aerosolized particles will spread. The hood may also contain the spread of the virus from less critically-ill patients, reducing the need for invasive procedures such as intubation.

>Sentencify --> Barrier protection, aerosol control (via negative pressure), optimal viewing clarity, flexible sealed armports, lightweight (<5 lbs), can be rapidly secured to any bed, fully disposable, scalable,
The versatility of the Apollo PIH means that it can be used in any care setting (OR, PACU, ICU, ED, EMS) and can be rapidly secured to a variety of beds.  The design allows for ease of assembly, use, and disposal. The primary structure is composed of a single flat sheet of PETG plastic that is assembled into a 3-dimensional form, minimizing the number of seams for optimal viewing clarity.  Flexible sealed armports provide...

### Design Concept
The primary design goal of the hood was to enclose the patient’s torso and head without restricting HCP ability to provide care or inducing claustrophobia in patients. The enclosure of the Apollo PIH derives its form and rigidity through the principle of active bending, a structural behavior achieved by the elastic deformation of initially flat elements. The main intention was to leverage this structural principle to create a stable, rapidly deployable 3D form that can be fabricated from readily available sheet materials using minimal joinery.

### Key Features
The primary design element of the Apollo PIH is the enclosure - a thin sheet of clear PET-G plastic in 60mil (approximately 1/16”) thickness.  The enclosure can be CNC cut from a flat sheet of PET-G  measuring a minimum of 48” x 72”.  The Apollo PIH enclosure measures approximately 22” in width, 23” in height and 22” in depth and is approximately 0.15 m3 in volume.

Several key features of the prototype are outlined below:
- (2) arm ports at the rear of the PIH provide healthcare provider (HCP) access to the patient. - An additional auxiliary port on one side of the PIH allows for additional patient access as needed.
- Minimal surface seams allow for an unobstructed view of patient.
- Adaptable attachment mechanism allows for use on a variety of bed types (OR, ICU, etc.)
- Side arms provide a double thickness at the base of the PIH for stability and structure
- Various suction ports accept common negative pressure hoses, including a ⅞” diameter (common in OR) as well as smaller 3/16” ID tubing (common in the ICU).
